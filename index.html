			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>How does population density intersect with transit availability?</b>
					<p>To answer this borad question, I chose to explore some more specific sub-questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How is the population distributed in the Boston area?</li>
						<li>How is the transportation network distributed?</li>
						<li>How many people live in transit deserts in the Boston area? Specifically, are there areas with high population density and few transit options?</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Motivation:</b> The background reading <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/transport/publication/transforming-the-urban-space-through-transit-oriented-development-the-3v-approach" target="_blank">Short Explainer on Transit-Oriented Development</a> emphasized clustering jobs, amenities, and services around transportation hubs. This made me curious about Boston's current urban layout and how well its population is served by transit.</p>
				</li>
		
				<li><b>How does income intersect with transit availability?</b>
					<p><b>Motivation:</b> The article from A1 <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/special-projects/spotlight-boston-housing/boston-towers-of-wealth/" target="_blank">Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</a> discussed how luxury housing developers were required to build affordable housing, but chose to do so a mile and a half away. This sparked my curiosity about whether luxury housing tends to be closer to better transit options, while affordable housing is pushed farther out, with fewer transit options.</p>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Is there an income difference between areas with rapid transit access versus those served only by bus services?</b>
					<p><b>Motivation:</b> From personal experience searching for apartments in Cambridge and assisting friends moving to the Boston area, I’ve found that transportation is often the key factor when choosing a place to live. People generally prefer the T over buses due to its reliability. This led me to wonder if neighborhoods with rapid transit access (like the T) tend to have higher income levels compared to those only served by bus transit.</p>

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

                    During initial exploration, I found that the population values given in the dataset (Source: US 2010 Census) were not in units that made logical sense. Boston was listed as having a population of 1369, a value that does not align with the accurate population of Boston even when units are changed to represent hundreds or thousands of people. Additionally, Boston was shown as having a relatively similar population to Franklin, which did not match my intuition on the population distribution in Massachusetts. Conversely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_Massachusetts" target="_blank">data pulled from Wikipedia</a> appears to much more accurately match my expectations on municipality population, and is used in Figure 2.

                    The map above visually represents municipal populations, with population size encoded through both point size and color for clarity. Densely populated areas are concentrated around Boston, with the city itself marked by a large red point. More sparsely populated municipalities are located further outward, beyond the urban sprawl and suburbs, extending into more rural regions. This type of population distribution suggests that a hub-and-spoke transit network might be used, with Boston at the center.

                    The map above displays the MBTA rapid transit and bus routes, with rapid transit shown in blue and bus routes in yellow. Both networks follow a hub-and-spoke model, centered on downtown Boston. However, the bus network is more interconnected and extends farther than the rapid transit system. Areas directly north and south of downtown Boston appear to be transit deserts when considering only rapid transit, yet are well-served by bus routes.

                    Census data reports income by household, so to explore income distributions, I first examined household sizes. I noticed that the distribution of household sizes shares the odd distribution as the population data discussed in Figure 1, as evidenced by the direct linear correlation in the plot above. Boston is shown as having fewer family households than Franklin, while Quincy (which we know from Figure 1 should be the second most populated municipality) is shown as having a very low comparative population and number of family households. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the entire dataset, not just the population field.

                    While the exact counts for each municipality in Figure 4 seemed questionable, the ratios appear accurate, and I will rely on them for household size and income data moving forward. The data aligns with what we would expect from a sum of all households in the given municipalities. There are more family households than non-family households, which is typical of suburban areas. Family sizes are most commonly 2, 3, or 4 people, rather than larger households, which aligns with the current average American family size. Similarly, non-family households are predominantly single-person, consistent with typical household trends. From this, we can calculate that the average household size in our dataset is 2.5.

                    To facilitate a more meaningful analysis of the data, it was grouped by county rather than individual municipalities, allowing for clearer interpretation at a broader geographical scale. The six counties depicted on the map above provide a more practical framework for understanding regional patterns, avoiding the complexities and granular details of municipal-level data. Note that while most counties are comprised of 10+ municipalities, Suffolk county is primarily comprised of Boston.

                    The above figure shows the county-level breakdown of household income, with household incomes represented by computed ranges. The range values were computed with references to the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-considered-poverty-level-2025-130046072.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK_eA06WOXeoWLmzI7218XEvoUKt7Nj-rlipFljkSSOPvckeVvS93P3KVtNU6inMEJLOzr2AWqUmfzHIm37MksCRtyGQezHRBW0r8n4Zat3cEs5uCSltH3CYLt_4MkPaEJYwnV2otUweXw_mjUYnAsP0ko4_dlrPxokRZiOZabsJ " target="_blank">national poverty line</a>, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/cost-of-living-by-state/ " target="_blank">cost of living in Massachusetts</a>, the <a href="https://datacommons.org/place/geoId/25?utm_medium=explore&mprop=income&popt=Person&cpv=age,Years15Onwards&hl=en" target="_blank">Massachusetts median income</a>, and the  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/middle-class-incomes-by-state.html#:~:text=Over%201%20in%205%20households,Bureau%20American%20Community%20Survey%20data" target="_blank">top 20% of Massachusetts earners</a>. Suffolk County stands out with a notably higher proportion of households living below the poverty line compared to other counties. As Suffolk County aligns with Boston proper, the hub of both our rapid transit and bus networks, this could suggest correlations between household income and transit reliance.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In this data exploration activity, I examined Census data on population, household size, and household income. I also looked at MBTA route information to compare income and population distributions against transit availability. Several key takeaways emerged from the analysis:</p>

            <p>First, the dataset appears to have some inconsistencies, or the metadata may be insufficient to properly interpret the data. Based on population sizes that don't align with easily verifiable real-world figures, I find the dataset difficult to trust. Similar discrepancies were noted in the household counts data.</p>
                
            <p>Second, transit in these municipalities largely follows a hub-and-spoke model, with Boston at the center. This structure is consistent with the population distribution. While there are areas that lack rapid transit access, the bus network is extensive and provides robust coverage across these areas.</p>
                
            <p>Finally, the data suggests that lower-income areas in Boston correlate with higher levels of transit availability, particularly rapid transit. This finding challenges the initial assumption I made in Question 3, that areas closer to the T would be more desirable and, therefore, dominated by higher-income residents. One possible explanation is that individuals with lower incomes are more reliant on public transit, while wealthier people may have the means to afford cars.</p>
